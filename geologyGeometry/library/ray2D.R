### RAYS IN 2D ###

# Some of the general machinery still works: rayNormalized, rayMeanScatter, rayProjectedMean, rayDistance.

#' Uniformly random points on the unit circle.
#' 
#' @param n A real number (positive integer) or NULL.
#' @return If n is NULL, then a single 2D ray. If n is a positive integer, then a list of n 2D rays.
ray2DUniform <- function(n=NULL) {
  if (is.null(n)) {
    angle <- runif(1, min=-pi, max=pi)
    c(cos(angle), sin(angle))
  }
  else
    replicate(n, rayUniform(), simplify=FALSE)
}

#' Random points on the unit circle, drawn from the wrapped normal distribution.
#' 
#' @param mean A 2D ray.
#' @param sd A real number (positive). The standard deviation sigma of the underlying normal distribution, in radians.
#' @param n A real number (positive integer) or NULL.
#' @return If n is NULL, then a single 2D ray. If n is a positive integer, then a list of n 2D rays.
ray2DWrappedNormal <- function(mean, sd, n=NULL) {
  if (is.null(n))
    ray2DWrappedNormal(mean, sd, 1)[[1]]
  else {
    angle <- atan2(mean[[2]], mean[[1]])
    angles <- rnorm(n, mean=angle, sd=sd)
    lapply(angles, function(a) c(cos(a), sin(a)))

#' Bootstrapped extrinsic mean for 2D rays.
#' 
#' The inference is based on percentiles of distance from the mean of the bootstrapped means. The user should check that the bootstrapped means form a unimodal symmetric distribution, before taking such a region seriously.
#' @param ls A list of 2D rays.
#' @param numBoots A real number (positive integer). The number of bootstrapped means to compute. 10,000 might be a good value.
#' @return A list ($center, $bootstraps, $pvalue, $q000, $q025, $q050, $q075, $q095, $q099, $q100). $bootstraps are the bootstraps. $center is their mean. The other fields are quantiles of distance from the mean, in radians, among the bootstraps. For example, a 95% confidence region consists of all 2D rays within $q095 of $center. $pvalue is an R function from 2D rays to real numbers, assigning a p-value to any given null hypothesis for the mean.

  empiricalCDF <- ecdf(dists)
  # Build the p-value function.
  f <- function(u) {
    1 - empiricalCDF(rayDistance(u, bootMean))
  }
  # Compute a few popular percentiles.
  qs <- quantile(dists, probs=c(0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.95, 0.99, 1.00), names=FALSE)
  list(center=bootMean, bootstraps=boots, pvalue=f,
       q000=qs[[1]], q025=qs[[2]], q050=qs[[3]], q075=qs[[4]], q095=qs[[5]], q099=qs[[6]], q100=qs[[7]])

#' Rose plot for 2D rays.
#' 
#' The data are binned. (Binning starts at the positive x-axis and proceeds counterclockwise. In a future release maybe we could add an offset, to start the binning elsewhere.) Each datum can be given a weight, which is tantamount to repeating the datum in the data set. Each petal in the Rose plot represents the total weight in a bin, either by area or by length. Concentric circles indictate the 10%, 20%, 30%, etc. weight levels.
#' @param rays A list of 2D or 3D real vectors. In each one, only the 2D projection (the first two components) is used. It must be non-zero but need not be unit.
#' @param weights A vector of real numbers. The weights to attach to the rays.
#' @param numBins The number of bins to use. For example, numBins == 36 means 10-degree-wide bins.
#' @param inner A real number (non-negative). This parameter reserves a circle of empty space at the center of the plot. More precisely, the plot takes place between radius inner and radius 1. inner == 0 seems traditional in geology, but I feel that inner == 0.25 (say) is prettier and easier to read.
#' @param areal Logical. If FALSE, then each petal's length is proportional to its bin's weight. If TRUE, then each petal's area is proportional to its bin's weight. areal == FALSE seems traditional in geology, but all data visualization advice I've ever seen suggests that areal == TRUE is the right choice.
#' @return NULL.
ray2DRosePlot <- function(rays, weights=replicate(length(rays), 1), numBins=36, inner=0, areal=TRUE) {
  # Bin the data, filling each bin with its fraction of the total weight.
  bins <- replicate(numBins, 0)

    heading <- atan2(rays[[i]][[2]], rays[[i]][[1]]) %% (2 * pi)
