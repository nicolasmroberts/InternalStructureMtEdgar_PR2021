# The complete 3D orientation of an object can be described using three perpendicular unit vectors in right-handed order. And actually the third vector is redundant, as it is simply the cross product of the other two. For example, the orientation of a duck in flight could be described by one vector pointing from its heart toward its head, and a second vector pointing from its heart out of its back. The particular convention that you use doesn't matter, as long as you use it consistently. You put these three vectors into the rows of a matrix R, which is then special orthogonal. This matrix is the rotation that rotates the vectors back to the x-, y-, and z-coordinate axes. In this file, 'rotation matrix' means 'real 3x3 matrix that is special orthogonal'.



### SYMMETRY GROUPS ###

# Frequently orientations are subject to some symmetry group G, which is a finite set of rotations (satisfying certain properties). For any rotation Q in G, the rotation matrix Q %*% R represents the same orientation as R does. Here are some common symmetry groups.

#' When trivial symmetry is used, the orientations are simply rotations. This case is so important that we have separate code, in rotations.R, for doing it. But let's include the trivial group, for completeness.
oriTrivialGroup <- list(diag(c(1, 1, 1)))

#' Ray-in-plane symmetry is applicable to faults-with-slip-directions, such as slickensides (and certain minerals).
oriRayInPlaneGroup <- list(
  diag(c(1, 1, 1)),

### TANGENT SPACE METHODS ###

# The tangent space methods all operate in the tangent space at a point. To apply them to orientations, simply pick the representative for each orientation that is closest to the point, using oriNearestRepresentative(s). As always, tangent space methods are best for data that are tightly concentrated.

# When working modulo a symmetry group, there is an additional upper bound on how spread out the data can be. Let r be the minimum distance between any two group elements. In other words, r is the distance from the identity to the nearest other group element. See rotSeparation. Let d be the diameter of the data set (oriDiameter). Then we can safely work with representatives as long as d < r / 2. For then oriNearestRepresentative never leaves the chosen set of representatives.



### BOOTSTRAPPING ###

#' Inference for mean orientations, based on non-parametric bootstrapping.
#' 
#' This function bootstraps the Frechet orientation mean, returning various pieces of information. The first is a list of the bootstrapped means. The user should oriEqualAnglePlot and oriEqualVolumePlot this list, to make sure that the means form a fairly tight ellipsoidal cluster. If so, then the second piece of information may be used: An R function that takes an orientation R0 as input, as produces as output a p-value for the hypothesis that the mean of the population is R0. This p-value is the fraction of means that are farther from the mean of means than R0 is, based on the Mahalanobis distance of the means.
#' @param rs A list of rotation matrices. The data.
#' @param numBoots A real number (positive integer). The number of bootstrap samples.
#' @param group A list of rotation matrices. The symmetry group G.
#' @return A list consisting of $bootstraps (a list of rotation matrices), $pvalueOri (an R function from {orientation matrices} to {real numbers}), and everything returned by rotMahalanobisPercentiles.
